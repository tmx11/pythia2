ALL MASTER MERGES VIA PR - Never merge to master directly. Always create PR via 'gh pr create' for user review in GitHub UI\n4. NO FORCE PUSHES - Never use --force or --force-with-lease without explicit permission\n5. ASK BEFORE DESTRUCTIVE OPS - Any command that could lose code/history requires explicit approval\n\nWORKFLOW FOR FEATURES:\n1. Create feature branch from master\n2. Commit work to feature branch\n3. Push feature branch to GitHub\n4. Create PR: gh pr create --base master --head feature/branch-name\n5. User reviews PR in GitHub UI\n6. User merges PR (or tells agent to)\n\nGit is dangerous.
